#    DAY 1: SUBLIME TEXT SHORTCUTS PRACTICE                                   #
#                                                                             #
#                                                                             #
#    1. In Sublime text you can select the word your cursor is on using       #
#    CTRL/Command-D. Click on the word "chickens" in this poem. Select the    #
#    whole word using the CTRL/Command+D shortcut.                            #
#                                                                             #
#    2. With the word selected, use the right arrow key to move the cursor to #
#    the end of the word "chickens." Add a period.                            #
#                                                                             #

#    In these exercises we'll change the spelling for colors/colours back     #
#    and forth from the American spelling (color) to the British spelling     #
#    (colours)                                                                #
#                                                                             #
#    3. Click on the first use of "colors" in the song "Colors of the Wind"   #
#    from the Disney movie Pocahontas. Use CTRL/Command+D to select the word. #
#    Once selected, press CTRL/Command+D again until all of the words "colors"#
#    are selected. Use the right arrow and navigate to after the letter "o"   #
#    and add a "u" to change to the British spelling.                         #
#                                                                             #
#    4. Use the Sublime Text multi-select feature to select each American     #
#    spelling of "colors" and change it back to the British spelling          #
#    "colours." Use "CTRL/command+double click" to select each of the words   #
#    "colors" one at a time and press the right arrow button to move to the   #
#    end of the selected words all at once. Use the left arrow button to      #
#    navigate to just after the letter "o" and add a "u" after it.            #
#                                                                             #
#    5. Now do a search for "colours." Use CTRL/Command+F to pull up search   #
#    click "Find All," and change them back to American spellings. Once they  #
#    are selected, press the right arrow and navigate to the letter "u" and   #
#    press backspace                                                          #
#                                                                             #

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
...
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind

#    6. In Sublime Text, you can delete everything after the cursor. Do so by #
#    pressing CTRL/Command + K twice. Do this for the sentence below, keeping #
#    the first sentence and removing the second.                              #
#                                                                             #
#    7. You can duplicate rows using CTRL/Command+Shift+D. Duplicate the      #
#    sentence five times.                                                     #

#    8. Click on one line and press CTRL/Command+L to select the whole line.  #
#                                                                             #

#    9. In Sublime Text, you can select all rows at once with                 #
#    CTRL/Command+Shift+L, which can be useful if dealing with Python objects #
#    like lists or dictionaries. Below is a data structure called a list of   #
#    tuples in Python, which we will cover in detail in a few days. From this #
#    list we want to create two lists of odd numbers (first element in each   #
#    tuple) and even numbers (second element in each tuple). To do this:      #
#         1. Select each row at once using CTRL/Command+Shift+L               #
#         2. Press the left arrow key to go to the beginning of the row.      #
#         3. Move the right cursor to just after the "("                      #
#         4. Press CTRL/Command+D to highlight the numbers                    #
#         5. Press CTRL+C to copy them                                        #
#         6. Paste them on a new line with CTRL+V                             #
#         7. Select the second to fifth rows of numbers you pasted at once    #
#         using CTRL/Command+Shift+L                                          #
#         8. Press the left arrow key to go to the beginning of the row.      #
#         9. Press backspace, add a space, and add a ","                      #
#         10. Select the comma-separated numbers and press "[" to wrap in     #
#         brackets                                                            #
#         11. Repeat for the even number list.                                #
#                                                                             #
